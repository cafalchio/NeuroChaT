A fork of an analysis toolset for Neuroscience.

## Things to do and considerations, not in priority order.

3. Print a message if you try to set to a non existant unit number.
4. Plot spike-rasters as lines instead of image-style.
5. Get ROC measurements by comparing a Gaussian to the distribution of spike amplitudes.

## Ideas

1. Cache the non moving periods of the subjects movement to avoid many calculations
2. Polynomial regression on phase vs position plots/
